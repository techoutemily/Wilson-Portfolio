				<h2 class="section__title">OVERVIEW</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>OVERVIEW: </strong>  FoodTrux is a mobile payment solution that allows users to find and order food from nearby food trucks, all in one simple, easy to use app. This clickable prototype meets the bare minimum requirements that were provided by the stakeholders by the means of user stories and required display views.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>PROBLEM: </strong>  There are many mobile payment solutions that exist currently, but there is no well-designed solution that pertains specifically to food trucks. There is a gap in the marketplace for an app that provides an end to end payments solution for food trucks.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>SOLUTION: </strong>  FoodTrux is an iOS app and mobile payment solution that provides users with one location to find food trucks nearby in real time, view a menu, select items for purchase and checkout. Users can also view their previous transactions, and provide feedback for each food truck they've purchased from. Foodtrux is a single solution that improves the payment process for food truck lovers.</p>

				<h2 class="section__title">RESEARCH</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>USER RESEARCH:  </strong> Conducted user research via interviews, user surveys, visiting food trucks in person, speaking with people in food truck lines, and by using existing apps and documenting the end to end payments process - what features worked and which features could be improved. My goal was to understand the current pros and cons of tools being used for locating and purchasing food from food trucks, and what a user would expect to see in an ideal end to end solution.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>100% of users have purchased food from a food truck before, if you count their local ice cream truck.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>5% of users have looked at the menu online before going to a food truck.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>0% of users have ever used a mobile payments solution to purchase food from a food truck.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>90% of users enjoy reading and/or writing reviews.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>70% of users have been aggravated with the length of the food truck line at least once.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>90% of users would appreciate a way to see all food trucks in the nearby area and learn about any promotional discounts or offerings.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>MARKET RESEARCH:</strong>  Conducted a competitive analysis to understand competitors such as Seamless, UberEATS and GrubHub. The takeaway from the analysis is that this app will be the first to provide an end to end payments solution for the food truck industry. If user experience is positive for both the food truck owners and the food truck consumers, then this app will be a success.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>STRENGTHS: Increase customer orders for food truck owners, improve food truck ordering experience for customers. Easy to use and well-designed.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>WEAKNESSES: Limited to select cities with food trucks, which limits overall user base. Accuracy of food truck details and order success depends on the food truck owners.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>OPPORTUNITIES: Rapidly growing food truck industry. Adoption and customer loyalty. Build sense of food truck community through rating & reviews.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>THREATS: Lots of competition when it comes to lunch, such as Seamless. There are also apps such as Twitter which allow you to find food trucks in real-time already.</p></strong></font>

				<h2 class="section__title">STRATEGY</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>USER STORIES:  </strong>  The user stories and many details for the display views were provided by the stakeholders in advance. The design team adhered to these requirements and then conducted extensive user testing to validate the design decisions.</p>
				<br></br>
				<div>
						<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>As a user, I want to select a truck: Once a user selects a truck from the map, an overlay or card should appear with some basic information, such as the name and distance from their current location. The user should have the ability to view more details about a food truck from this overlay.</p></strong></font>
						<br></br>
						<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>As a user, I want to see a detail view: A food truck detail view should contain more information about its current location, hours of operation, food selections by category, and reviews of the food and service.</p></font>
						<br></br>
						<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>As a user, I want to view the menu: Displaying a menu that's categorized by meal type will allow users to find food options with ease, and add them to their cart. You should give them the ability to change the quantity if they choose to order more than one of each item selected.</p></strong></font>
						<br></br>
						<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>As a user, I want to create an account: Users will want to make the payment process simple, so allow them to create an account, save a credit card and set it up as their default payment.</p></font>
						<br></br>
						<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>As a user, I want to review recent transactions: Within the account settings, users need a way to view past transactions. This should be in the form of a list, consisting of the name of the food truck and final cost. If the user selects a transaction, they should be able to view the details of the order.</p></strong></font>
				</div>
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>USER PERSONAS:  </strong> Personas were representative of the user research that was conducted via surveys and interviews. Personas  were created for both food truck consumers and food truck owners. The personas allowed our design team to understand user goals, behaviors, and how they will use the app. Here is a persona for a food truck owner.</p>

				<h2 class="section__title">VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>WIREFRAMES:  </strong> The design process for FoodTrux included rough sketches on pen and paper, low-fidelity wireframes, and then finally high-fidelity wireframes. Testing was completed at each phase in order to optimize the design.</p>

				<h2 class="section__title">TESTING</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>RESULTS: </strong>User flow testing was conducted for tasks such as selecting a food truck, viewing the menu, adding an item to the cart, and checking out with a new or saved credit card. Additionally, one of the tasks that users were asked to complete was to go from the list view to the map view. The results revealed that the “map” and “list” buttons at the top of the page were excessive and taking up too much space, when users could easily use the arrow to swipe between the list and map views. Extensive testing and continuous iterations led to several usability improvements. User testing videos are available upon request.</p>
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<h2 class="section__title">CONCLUSION</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>SOLUTION: </strong> The result is a well designed solution which brought the stakeholders vision to life. FoodTrux is the first mobile payment solution which allows users to find and order food from nearby food trucks, all in one simple, easy to use application. This was the first iOS app that I built so I really enjoyed learning about the Apple iOS Human Interface Guidelines and adhering to those requirements. One of the biggest takeaways I had from this exercise was managing stakeholder requirements and expectations, while making sure to put the users first. User testing gave me the data I needed to back my design decisions and ultimately satisfy the stakeholders.</p>
