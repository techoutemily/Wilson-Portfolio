				<h2 class="section__title">OVERVIEW</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>Overview: </strong>  FoodTrux is a mock mobile payment solution that allows users to find and order food from nearby food trucks, all in one simple, easy to use application. This clickable prototype meets the bare minimum requirements that were provided by the stakeholders by the means of user stories and required display views.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>Problem: </strong>  There are many mobile payment solutions that exist currently, but there is no well-designed solution that pertains specifically to food trucks. There is a gap in the marketplace for an app that provides an end to end payments solution for food trucks.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>Solution: </strong>  FoodTrux is an iOS app and mobile payment solution that provides users with one location to find food trucks nearby in real time, view a menu, select items for purchase and checkout. Users can also view their previous transactions, and provide feedback for each food truck they've purchased from. Foodtrux is a single solution that improves the payment process for food truck lovers.</p>

				<h2 class="section__title">RESEARCH</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>USER RESEARCH:  </strong>  Conducted user research via interviews, user surveys, visiting food trucks in person, speaking with people in food truck lines, and by using existing apps and documenting the end to end payments process - what features worked and which features could be improved.</p>
				<h3><font color="#10B6E8"><strong></h3></strong>
				<br></br>
				<h3><strong>100% of surveyed users have purchased food from a food truck before, if you count their local ice cream truck.</h3></strong>
				<br></br>
				<h3><strong>5% of surveyed users have looked at the menu online before going to a food truck.</h3></strong>
				<br></br>
				<h3><strong>0% of surveyed users have ever used a mobile payments solution to purchase food from a food truck.</h3></strong>
				<br></br>
				<h3><strong>90% of surveyed users enjoy reading and/or writing reviews.</h3></strong>
				<br></br>
				<h3><strong>70% of surveyed users have been aggravated with the length of the food truck line at least once.</h3></strong>
				<br></br>
				<h3><strong>90% of surveyed users would appreciate a way to see all food trucks in the nearby area and learn about any promotional discounts or offerings.</h3></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>MARKET RESEARCH:  </strong>   Conducted a Competitive Analysis to understand competitors such as Seamless, UberEATS and GrubHub. The takeaway from the analyis is that this app will be the first to provide an end to end payments solution for the food truck industry. If user experience is positive, then this app will be a success.</p>
				<br></br>
				<h3><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>STRENGTHS: Increase customer orders for food truck owners, improve food truck ordering experience for customers. Easy to use and well-designed.</h3></strong>
				<br></br>
				<h3><strong>WEAKNESSES: Limited to select cities with food trucks, which limits overall user base. Accuracy of food truck details and order success depends on the food truck owners.</h3></strong>
				<br></br>
				<h3><strong>OPPORTUNITIES: Rapidly growing food truck industry. Adoption and customer loyalty. Build sense of food truck community through rating & reviews.</h3></strong>
				<br></br>
				<h3><strong>THREATS: Lots of competition when it comes to lunch, such as Seamless. There are also apps such as Twitter which allow you to find food trucks in real-time already.</h3></strong></font>

				<br></br>
				<p><strong>USER STORIES:  </strong>  The user stories and many details for the display views were provided by the stakeholders in advance. The design team adhered to these requirements and then conducted extensive user testing to validate the design decisions. Here is a sample of the user stories.</p>

				<p><strong>USER PERSONAS:  </strong> Developed in Sketch and based off of the user research that was conducted via surveys and interviews. This allowed our design team to understand the users’ goals, behaviors, and how they will use the application. Here is a sample persona for a food truck owner.</p>

				<p><strong>WIREFRAMES:  </strong> Low-fidelity wireframes were created on pen and paper and then Sketch to display content placement options for the stakeholders. High-fidelity wireframes were then created to provide exact sizing of each element. Testing was completed through Peek to validate the user flow and design decisions.</p>

				<h2 class="section__title">TESTING</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>RESULTS: </strong> One of the tasks that users were asked to complete was to go from the list view to the map view. The results revealed that the “map” and “list” buttons at the top of the page were excessive and taking up too much space, when users could easily use the arrow to swipe between the list and map views. Based off of the feedback we made updates to improve the usability and also please the stakeholders.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>User testing videos are availabe upon request.</p>
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<h2 class="section__title">CONCLUSION</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>SOLUTION: </strong>  This was the first iOS app that I built so I really enjoyed learning about Apple’s iOS Human Interface Guidelines and adhering to those requirements. The biggest takeaway I had from this exercise was managing the stakeholder’s requirement’s and expectations, while making sure to put the users first. User testing through Peek and UsabilityHub gave me the data I needed to back my design decisions. </p>
				<br></br>
				<p>The result is a well designed solution which brought the stakeholder’s vision to life. FoodTrux is the first mobile payment solution which allows users to find and order food from nearby food trucks, all in one simple, easy to use application.</p>
