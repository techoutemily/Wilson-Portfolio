				<h2 class="section__title">OVERVIEW</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>OVERVIEW: </strong>  Water biking is a luxury sport that is becoming quite trendy. Start up companies are beginning to build new water bike designs and market them directly to consumers. Shopping for a water bike is difficult for a consumer because there is no single solution which enables consumers to learn about the sport in general, view all available water bike models from multiple companies, browse water bikes by category, see technical specifications, pictures, videos, read reviews, and experience an easy checkout process. We made it our mission to research and design an e-commerce platform that would improve customer experience for water biking consumers.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>PROBLEM: </strong>  Shopping for a water bike is very difficult for a consumer today. It’s a new trend so many consumers have not actually tried it before, so they require as much information as possible, including specs, pictures, videos, and reviews of the product. Many older water bike companies provide poor user experience, request phone calls for purchase, don’t have enough information on the different models, and they market towards resorts instead of consumers. Currently no water bike company makes it simple to shop water bikes by category. There is also no one stop shop to evaluate and compare water bikes models from multiple vendors, so research can be difficult and time consuming.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>SOLUTION: </strong>  SEABIKES was designed to make it simple to learn about the sport, browse water bikes by category, see pictures and videos, view the technical specifications, read reviews, and checkout seamlessly, all in one simple to use application.</p>

				<h2 class="section__title">RESEARCH</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>USER RESEARCH:  </strong>  Conducted through interviews and surveys which allowed us to ask potential users questions regarding functionality and features of the solution. Based off of the responses, we were able to determine what problem we were attempting to solve and also who our target audience would be.</p>
				<h3><font color="#10B6E8"><strong></h3></strong>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>70% of surveyed users have never been on a water bike.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>80% of surveyed users would like to ride a water bike if given the opportunity.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>5% of surveyed users know someone who has shown interest in purchasing a water bike, or have already purchased one.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>90% of surveyed users said that they would feel comfortable purchasing a water bike online if the site provided extensive information about the product.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>MARKET RESEARCH:</strong>Competitive Analysis was completed to shed light on potential competitors, and to determine how SEABIKES could differentiate itself. Many older competitors such as Castle Craft provided extremely poor user experience with “calls to action” buttons not even working, while the newer startup companies such as Schiller and Manta5 were impressive but did not let users shop by category and easily compare models from various vendors.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>STRENGTHS: Effective messaging with clear product descriptions, intuitive navigation structure with a modern and responsive design aimed at increasing conversion rates, provides the ability for users to easily compare water bikes by category.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>WEAKNESSES: There are not many product ratings or reviews on the website yet, which is needed for customers with little or no exposure to the product.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>OPPORTUNITIES: Growing water bike industry, first to provide ability to compare water bike models in one easy to use website.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>THREATS: Competition such as start up companies like Schiller or Manta5.</p></strong></font></font>

				<p><strong>USER PERSONAS:  </strong> Personas were created in Sketch and were based on the user research. Some potential users were open to water sports in general, while others were cyclists who were interested in water bikes for training purposes. Here is an example of one of the personas.</p>
				<br></br>
				<div align="center" class="mockbg"/>
					<img src="img/personapic3.png"/>
					<br></br>
					<h2>Winnie Chen</h2>
					<p>AVID CYCLIST - KEEP TRAINING INTERESTING</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>AGE: 27</p>
					<p>CAREER: Systems Engineer</p>
					<p>LOCATION: Vermont</p>
					<p>GENDER: Female</p>
					<br></br>
				</div>
				<div>
				<p>MOTIVATIONS: Winnie is an avid cyclist and the pack lead of her cycling group. The group looks up to her to set the pace and to be a thought leader for all things cycling. She is interested in water biking to keep the training interesting during the summer months</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>GOALS: Ride the water bike on hot summer days allowing for the same intense workout that a regular bicycle would provide, introduce a new relevant hobby to her cycling team, train hard for the next cycling race.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>FRUSTRATIONS: Winnie does not know anyone who has purchased a water so she would have to rely heavily on the information provided online. She needs a way to compare water bikes easily so that she chooses the right model.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>BIO: Winnie is a competitive and talented athlete who is always looking for ways to keep training interesting. She lives near the beach and has tried kayaking, canoeing, sailing, and windsurfing. Trying new sports and staying active will be her biggest focus for this coming summer.</p>

				<h2 class="section__title">VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>BRANDING:  </strong>The brand identity for Seabikes was developed from scratch, including the brand name, logo, typography, layout, color palette, and style guide. Through my initial brand exploration for Seabikes, I determined that “simple, trustworthy, and modern” should be the traits associated with the company. Extensive research verified that the most important visual feature on the app is the product details, including the specifications, pictures, and videos. The rest of the interface is designed to showcase those product details and minimize any frustrations or distractions. The color palette consists of cool blues and greens, and a warm orange sun, reminding the user that they can soon take their water bike to the beach. A single typeface was chosen to increase simplicity, though different shades were leveraged, along with a visual hierarchy to aid the users with reading the material on each display view very rapidly, without thinking.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>Moodboards, list making, mind mapping, and early sketches are available upon request.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>WIREFRAMES:  </strong>Low-fidelity wireframes were created on Axure then uploaded into InVision for user testing. Many changes were made based off of the user testing, and then the high-fidelity wireframes were created on Sketch to provide exact sizing of each element. Further testing was conducted through Peek. The feedback gave us the data we needed to make improvements on user flow and design decisions.</p>

				<h2 class="section__title">TESTING</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>EXAMPLE 1: </strong>One game changing moment was when a user complained about having to sign in before browsing products. The user felt discouraged and annoyed that he was being asked to do something before he even knew if he was interested. We reworked the design and delayed the Sign In/Sign Up process until checkout to improve the user experience. On-going testing is being done to determine if this change is increasing conversion rates.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>EXAMPLE 2: </strong>The design team created a preference test on Usability Hub to determine whether the color of the shopping cart should be orange or blue. The results were fairly even, but more users preferred an orange color over the blue color that I had been using for other links. Further navigation testing was done on Peek and the orange color was causing frustration for users because they were not sure whether the shopping cart was clickable. The design team changed the color back to the consistent blue color and there were no more frustrations.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>EXAMPLE 3: </strong>A Five Second Test was conducted to understand how the app made users think and feel, and if they could understand the purpose of the app. First impressions are important for e-commerce companies as there is a lot of competition. The results confirmed that the users trusted the application and could clearly define the purpose.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>User testing videos are availabe upon request.</p>
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<h2 class="section__title">CONCLUSION</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>SOLUTION: </strong>The water biking industry is rapidly growing and there is a great opportunity for SEABIKES to lead the way in sales by creating an end to end e-commerce platform that makes it easy for users to shop for water bikes. The design team of SEABIKES took the time to really understand their potential users and competitors through extensive research.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>The result is a simple solution that allows users to learn about the sport, browse water bikes by collection, see pictures and videos, view the technical specifications, read reviews, and checkout seamlessly, all in one simple to use application.</p>
