				<h2 class="section__title">OVERVIEW</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>OVERVIEW: </strong>Seabikes is an e-commerce mobile app designed to increase conversion rates for online purchases of water bikes.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>PROBLEM: </strong>Shopping for water bikes can be very difficult for a user today, because there is no single solution that enables users to learn about the sport in general, view all of the available water bike models from multiple companies, browse water bikes by category, see technical specifications, pictures, videos, read reviews, and experience a simple checkout process. Many older water bike companies provide poor user experience, request phone calls for purchase, don’t have enough product details, and some market towards resorts instead of consumers. The newer start up companies are impressive but none of them allow a consumer to compare water bikes from multiple companies or shop by category. Choosing a water bike to purchase can be very time consuming and frustrating for a user today.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>SOLUTION: </strong>Seabikes was designed to make it simple to learn about the sport, browse water bikes by category, see pictures and videos, view the technical specifications, read reviews, and checkout seamlessly, all in one simple to use app.</p>

				<h2 class="section__title">RESEARCH</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>USER RESEARCH:  </strong> Interviews and surveys were conducted in order to ask potential users questions regarding their knowledge about water biking, their experience with online purchasing, and what features and functionality they would like included in the solution. Based on the results, it was determined that the majority of potential users would be purchasing a water bike for the first time. Extensive product details including pictures, videos, specifications, and reviews would be needed for the users to feel comfortable about the online purchase.</p>
				<h3><font color="#10B6E8"><strong></h3></strong>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>70% of users have never been on a water bike.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>90% of users would like to ride a water bike if given the opportunity.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>5% of users know someone who has shown interest in purchasing a water bike, or have already purchased one.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>90% of users said that they would feel comfortable purchasing a water bike online if the site provided extensive information about the product.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>MARKET RESEARCH:</strong> A competitive analysis was completed to understand the competitive landscape, what worked, what did not work, and how Seabikes could differentiate itself. All research was documented and here were some of the key findings.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>Older competitors such as Castle Craft provided extremely poor user experience with links not working, not enough product details, extremely cluttered content, and the websites were not responsive and easy to view on a mobile device.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>Several competitors were marketing water bikes to resorts instead of consumers.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>Newer water bike startup companies such as Schiller and Manta5 were impressive with product details, reviews, and had simple checkout processes.</p></strong></font>
				<br></br>
				<p><font color="#10B6E8"><strong>The newer startup companies did not let users shop by category or easily compare models from various vendors.</p></strong></font></font>
				<br></br>
				<p>My recommendation for Seabikes is to get a minimum viable product out quickly in order to capitalize on the growing market. Seabikes will be the first company to provide a single solution allowing users to evaluate water bikes from various vendors, and shop by category. The solution will need to have effective messaging, clear product descriptions, and have an intuitive navigation structure with a modern and responsive design. The solution will need to have enough product information to make first time water bike buyers feel confident during the checkout process.</p>

				<h2 class="section__title">VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>BRANDING:  </strong>The brand identity for Seabikes was developed from scratch, including the brand name, logo, typography, layout, color palette, and style guide. Through my initial brand exploration for Seabikes, I determined that “simple, trustworthy, and modern” should be the traits associated with the company. Extensive research verified that the most important visual feature on the app is the product details, including the specifications, pictures, and videos. The rest of the interface is designed to showcase those product details and minimize any frustrations or distractions. The color palette consists of cool blues and greens, and a warm orange sun, reminding the user that they can soon take their water bike to the beach. A single typeface was chosen to increase simplicity, though different shades were leveraged, along with a visual hierarchy to aid the users with reading the material on each display view very rapidly, without thinking.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>Moodboards, list making, mind mapping, and early sketches are available upon request.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>WIREFRAMES:  </strong> Sketches and low-fidelity wireframes were created for early user testing, and then the high-fidelity wireframes were created to provide exact sizing of each element. Extensive user research was conducted to validate design decisions.</p>

				<h2 class="section__title">TESTING</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>EXAMPLE 1: </strong>One game changing moment was when a user complained about having to sign in before browsing products. The user felt discouraged and annoyed that he was being asked to do something before he even knew if he was interested. We reworked the design and delayed the Sign In/Sign Up process until checkout to improve the user experience. On-going testing is being done to determine if this change is increasing conversion rates.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>EXAMPLE 2: </strong>The design team created a preference test to determine whether the color of the shopping cart should be orange or blue. The results were fairly even, but more users preferred an orange color over the blue color that I had been using for other links. Further navigation testing was done, and it was determined that the orange color was causing frustration for users because they were not sure whether the orange shopping cart was clickable. The design team changed the color back to the consistent blue color and there were no more frustrations.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>EXAMPLE 3: </strong>A Five Second Test was conducted to understand how the app made users think and feel, and if they could understand the purpose of the app. First impressions are important for e-commerce companies as there is a lot of competition. The results confirmed that the users trusted the application and could clearly define the purpose.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>User testing videos are availabe upon request.</p>
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<h2 class="section__title">CONCLUSION</h2>
				<br></br>
				<p><strong>SOLUTION: </strong>The water biking industry is rapidly growing and there is a great opportunity for Seabikes to capture market share quickly by providing an end to end e-commerce platform that makes it easy for users to shop for water bikes. The result is a simple solution that allows users to learn about the sport, browse water bikes by collection, see pictures and videos, view the technical specifications, read reviews, and checkout seamlessly, all in one simple to use app. Further research is being conducted around additional ways to categorize the bikes other than “casual” and “professional.” Research is also being conducted to understand how to best expand the offering to resorts.</p>
